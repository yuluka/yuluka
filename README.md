<h2 align="center"> ⚡About me⚡ </h2>
<p>
<b>Hi there! I'm Yuluka</b>, an avid coding enthusiast and especially backend development. I am a software engineering student at ICESI University.

Professionally, I mainly focus on Java and Python development; of different types of software, from desktop applications, to Machine Learning and web applications; I also usually work with databases (SQL and NoSQL). I have honed my expertise over 4 years of dedicated practice and learning, in which I have been a student at my current university and have participated in different projects in search of enhancing such knowledge. I am passionate about leveraging these skills to become a fruitful developer, in search of providing computerized solutions to the problems that fill our environment.

Although those are my strongest skills, I also perform very well in areas such as web development using JavaScript (NestJS, for example), or problem solving using data structures in languages like Scala or even Python.

In my passage through diverse projects and experiences, I have come to embrace collaboration, innovation, the relentless pursuit of excellence, and the constant hunger for knowledge that nurtures and propels my professional and personal worth.

I believe in the power of continuous improvement and constantly seek new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether it's through learning platforms, or diving headfirst into a new project, I'm always eager to grow and evolve.

This GitHub repository serves as a testament to my journey, showcasing not only my past accomplishments, but also my ongoing projects and efforts. I invite you to explore and connect, as together we can create something truly extraordinary.
